              	<span class="dropcap style-1">G</span>reetings to you in the name of the Almighty Creator, I am Baba Ojonugwa also known as J.F.O.
				After searching my conscience, with due consultation with my family,ward,district, state constituency, local government area, federal constituency, senatorial district & like minds, I intend to contest for a seat in the Federal House of Representatives during the coming elections to represent the good people of ANKPA/ OLAMABORO / OMALA local government areas.
				I am humbled by the earnestness of those who sought to encourage & even discourage me to take this bold step to represent my people in the Federal House of Representatives & I thank you all for believing in this dream to be part of a better representation for the people of ANKPA/OLAMABORO/ OMALA federal constituency.
				Honestly speaking, to me,  venturing for office into the Nigerian National Assembly is like an adventure into a place that has most often  resembled the facsimile of the Nigerian political Sodom & Gomorrah.
				Our National Assembly is often reffered to as a cesspool of corruption, an oasis of immorality and an open sewage of political prostitution and bastardry.
				But then, our National Assembly is only a microcosm of the larger society from where our parliamentarians were drawn & it is in response to the faith, persistence & believe that my people of ANKPA OLAMABORO OMALA federal constituency deserve a better representation at the national assembly experience that I seek candidacy for election into the Federal House of Representatives. </p>
				<blockquote class="blockquote-style-1 mb-30">
              <p>
                I entertain no illusion about the ponderousness of the challenges I am about to undertake.
				I am eager to hit the campaign trails and discuss with my people the serious issues confronting the Nigerian multi-national enterprise as it affects my federal constituency. 
              </p>
              <span class="pull-right">â€• Baba J. Ojonugwa, J.F.O</span>

				<p style="text-align: justify;">
				<span class="dropcap style-1">I</span> am confident that by God's grace, we can terminate the metastasis of parliamentary indecorum, Executive vacillation and the concomitant national malaise that have plagued us. 
				My confidence is rooted in the belief that most man-made problems can be solved and are eventually solved by man under the inspiration of God. But inspiration alone does not suffice; it must be combined with the perspiration that exudes from hard work and courageous deeds. 
				I do not believe that Nigeria will get better through endless prayers,night vigils and religious jamborees alone. We, Nigerians, must wake up to the truth that faith without works is metaphysical hogwash, nonsense and silly abracadabra. Nigeria can only get better when we stand up to work for it to be better while praying alongside.
				As Nigerians, we must summon the courage to change from the ritualism of pigeonholed religion to the rectitude of genuine spirituality.
				The notion of sowing and reaping is more than a casual metaphor. It is a universal law that is as efficacious as the laws of gravity, relativity or thermodynamics. 
				As is the case with an individual or family, the way you dress your bed is how you lay on it. 
				For far too long, Nigerians have slept on the wrong bed. It is time for us to lay a new bed; you cant expect a different result when you do the same thing on and on, in fact according to experts, doing the same thing and expecting a different result is actually madness & I know the people of Ankpa, Olamaboro & Omala local government area are not mad.

				My dear good citizens of Ankpa, Olamaboro & Omala local government area, it is time for us to be different in our approach so we can achieve a better result; it is time for us to be <b>THE DIFFERENCE</b>. We have traded the dream of a great federal constituency for the nightmare of stagnation and paralysis; now is time for us to be <b>THE DIFFERENCE</b>.
				My name is Baba Ojonugwa J.F.O, I am your son, your brother and friend, I am positively <b>THE DIFFERENCE</b> & I seek your support as I run for member federal house of representative, representing the good people of Ankpa, Olamaboro & Omala local government areas of Kogi state.
